# Brain Bash

Brain Bash is a colorful, interactive quiz game built with React that lets users test their trivia skills using the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/). With progress tracking, visual feedback, score summaries, and a question-by-question recap, with the intention of being both fun and educational. Still a work in progress
